Welcome to my personal website! This site serves as a showcase of my skills, experience, and projects. As a passionate developer and self-proclaimed geek, I have created this website to share my journey in the world of coding and technology.

The website is built using JavaScript, React and Bootstrap, and features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
